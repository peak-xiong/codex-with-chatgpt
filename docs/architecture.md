# Machine-Wide Architecture

## Goal

C2C connects any number of local Codex workspaces to ChatGPT with one machine
configuration. The transport is shared, while workspace data and conversation
state remain isolated.

The key distinction is:

- **Machine scope:** one OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel, one connector, one gateway
  process and one machine identity.
- **Workspace scope:** one trusted local root, one stable Project identity and
  one registration in the machine gateway.
- **Session scope:** one local Codex session, one ChatGPT Project chat and one
  owned browser page.
- **Turn scope:** one short-lived capability, one mailbox request and one
  ordered control message.

### OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel

The official pinned tunnel client is installed into protected machine state.
Its runtime key is supplied by file reference and is never placed in a command
line argument, connector instruction, repository file, or normal output.

The tunnel supervises exactly:

```text
node <checkout>/bin/c2c.js serve-machine --stdio --port 0
```

The `stdio` stream is the MCP data transport. The child also exposes a
loopback-only admin API on an ephemeral port for local registration and turn
issuance. C2C reuses the pair only when the 0.0.14 status payload reports a
healthy runtime whose alias, `tunnel_id`, `profile_path`, target kind and
`target_value` match the configured profile and exact `serve-machine` command,
and whose gateway association and health checks match. When the status payload
includes a child PID, it must also match the gateway runtime PID. The pinned
0.0.14 client may omit that PID, so exact target, association and health checks
remain the primary proof. This is still a status-backed local configuration
match rather than a cryptographic process identity proof. A healthy standalone
gateway is not adopted as a second broker.

ChatGPT selects the Secure Tunnel configured for this connector. There is no
public Server URL for the user to copy into project or workspace settings.

### Machine autostart

On macOS, one LaunchAgent may be enabled for the whole machine after setup:

```sh
c2c autostart enable --json
c2c autostart status --json
```

launchd runs hidden `c2c autostart run --quiet`. That entry point only invokes
`ensureMachineGateway`, which reuses the official Tunnel-owned child. It does
not start a per-workspace process, create another Tunnel, or schedule browser
pages. Disable it with `c2c autostart disable --json`.

### Machine Gateway

The gateway owns the in-memory capability broker and workspace registry. A
machine lifetime record contains `machineId`, `bootEpoch`, `pid`, port and an
admin secret. Startup is exclusive; cleanup is allowed only when all of those
owner fields still match.

The MCP server does not infer a workspace from a global “active project” or
from a ChatGPT URL. It accepts only a valid `context_id`, resolves the context
to a registered workspace, and performs the requested read within that root.

Machine state is split by privilege. Mutable project state stays inside the
repository boundary: Git checkouts use `<git-common-dir>/codex-with-chatgpt`,
while non-Git workspaces use `<workspace-root>/.codex-with-chatgpt`. Linked
worktrees share project metadata and a non-authoritative page recovery mirror;
session routes and execution records are isolated below
`workspaces/<workspaceId>/`. Runtime installations, the authoritative mailbox,
Tunnel configuration and keys, the authoritative cross-workspace Project URL,
physical-tab and generation ownership index, gateway ownership records,
machine identity, locks and logs remain in protected machine state.
`sandbox-clean` removes obsolete global write grants and does not expose a
machine-wide state directory to Codex.

### Workspace registry

Registration canonicalizes the root and records:

```text
workspaceId     checkout-specific identity
projectId       stable project identity
registrationId  current registration generation
root            trusted local filesystem root
workspace name  display metadata
```

The registry verifies the current root on every data-plane claim. Re-registering
after a checkout move or replacement creates a new registration and revokes
capabilities issued to the old registration. A path or Project name supplied by
ChatGPT cannot create or select a registration.

Every explicit or stale-registration removal uses the same lifecycle path. It
revokes capabilities for the exact registration, then removes machine surface
ownership only when no valid checkout for that stable `projectId` remains.

## Browser and conversation ownership

Each Project has one C2C connector association, but each local session has its
own conversation. The protected machine index stores the Project association
independently:

```text
projectId -> normalized projectUrl
```

That association remains after the last session is retired, so a new session
or linked worktree can discover and reuse the existing Project. It is removed
only when the last registered checkout for the project is unregistered. A
surface lease maps:

```text
projectId + localSessionId
  -> browserId + surfaceId + tabId + projectUrl + chatUrl
  -> generation + ownerProcessEpoch + expiresAt
```

The mapping is persistent. A new session creates a new Project chat and a new
owned page even if another C2C page is open. A page rotation must present the
exact current generation, so a stale session cannot steal a replacement.
The Gateway serializes updates under one machine lock and enforces one local
project per normalized ChatGPT Project URL plus one owner per physical page.
Workspace mirrors are never imported into this authority. A machine-wide
allocator keeps generations monotonic across release, expiry, and session
retirement while inactive per-session entries are pruned.

The machine-wide capacity is 100 unexpired session/page leases, counted by
unique `(projectId, localSessionId)` identities, each representing one
workspace-local session owner. Up to 100 independent local sessions can own
pages and run concurrently. When all 100 leases are held, a claim for a new
101st session is rejected with a retryable capacity result; the caller must
wait, back off, and retry after a lease is released, expires, or the owning
session is retired. Renewing, idempotently reclaiming, or replacing a page for
an existing session reuses its slot and does not increase the count. Only
messages belonging to the same `localSessionId` are serialized; independent
sessions are never queued behind one another.

The Skill keeps the owned pages in the built-in browser. Computer Use targets
the exact `tabId` and uses stable URLs plus semantic DOM operations. The CUA
host runtime executes the browser calls; TypeScript persists and validates the
lease but cannot invoke the host CUA APIs directly. For a saved route, it first
executes `cua.getTab(tabId, { browser: "iab" })` and validates the returned
Project/chat URL. If that exact tab is unavailable or its URL is wrong, it
executes `cua.createBrowserTab("iab", targetUrl, { visible: false })`, where
`targetUrl` is the saved chat URL or Project URL, and replaces the lease only
for the same `localSessionId` using the exact current generation and tab id.
A saved route without a `tabId` is invalid and follows this same replacement
branch; it never authorizes choosing an existing tab by URL.
With no saved route, it creates a hidden Project candidate the same way. It
never selects another tab by URL, title, recency, or foreground state, and it
never reuses the user's ordinary ChatGPT page.

Normal control stays in the background: immediately before sending and after
sending, the Skill re-reads the same exact `tabId` and verifies the Project/chat
URL. It uses semantic DOM operations and does not focus or activate the page.
It never passes `visible: true` for a normal control turn.
Only login, CAPTCHA, 2FA, or explicit consent may temporarily require a
visible page; after that user action the page returns to the background and
the exact-tab and URL checks run again.

## Turn capability lifecycle

Before a control message, the local harness:

1. Confirms the session route and surface generation.
2. Opens one mailbox request for `(workspaceId, localSessionId, taskId,
   iteration, phase)`.
3. Issues a capability bound to the same correlation, current registration,
   exact mailbox `requestId`, compaction epoch, surface generation and
   requested scopes. BOOT uses the same request binding and its receipt gates
   the first route commit.
4. Places `CONTEXT_ID` and `RESULT_REQUEST_ID` in the prompt sent to the owned
   chat.

ChatGPT passes `context_id` to every MCP call. The gateway claims a lease,
renews it during a long operation and releases it in a `finally` path. On
completion, the broker creates a fence and waits for all leases to drain before
the mailbox is written. If mailbox persistence fails, the fence aborts rather
than claiming the result was delivered.

Completion or cancellation revokes the capability. Gateway restart changes the
boot epoch and invalidates all prior capabilities. Compaction or a page
generation change invalidates a stale turn even when its token has not expired.

## Concurrency model

The system has two independent ordering rules:

```text
Session A: turn 1 -> turn 2 -> turn 3
Session B: turn 1 -> turn 2
Session C: turn 1 -> turn 2 -> ...

A, B, and C execute independently.
```

The mailbox and capability records do not consume additional page-capacity
slots. Surface ownership has one machine-wide capacity of 100 unexpired
session/page leases, with one slot per unique `(projectId, localSessionId)`
identity. Released,
expired, and retired leases free their slot; a new-session claim at capacity is
rejected with a retryable result and retries only after one becomes available.
Renewals, idempotent claims, and page replacements for an existing session
reuse its slot. Bounded terminal tombstones and per-turn activity leases
remain cleanup protections. Backoff, retry, and browser recovery are scoped
to the affected session only.

Normal mailbox `open`, `ack`, `cancel`, and result operations use a lifecycle
lock for the specific `localSessionId`; they do not scan or serialize the whole
workspace. Pruning uses a separate short maintenance lock and processes
sessions independently. The surface metadata ownership lock is only a brief
atomic uniqueness guard for lease commits/replacements; it never limits or
queues browser turns.

## Data boundaries

ChatGPT receives no pasted repository dump. It uses read-only MCP tools for
directory listing, bounded file reads, search, Git state/diff, and execution
records. Codex keeps write operations and command execution local.

The Project URL and chat URL provide continuity and navigation. They are not
trusted authorization values. Authorization comes from the machine gateway's
capability binding and the trusted local root.

## Recovery ownership

`machine start` and `machine doctor` operate on the one machine runtime. They
check the status-matched tunnel runtime target, gateway health, owner record and
bound admin port.
`machine stop` stops the tunnel supervisor first; the child exits through its
stdio owner. C2C does not send a child shutdown request while the supervisor is
still responsible for it.

If one browser page fails, only that session renews or replaces its surface
lease. Other sessions, pages, workspace registrations and their conversations
continue unaffected.

## Design decisions

- One connector reduces user configuration to one machine-level action.
- `Authentication: None` keeps connector setup independent of workspace
  credentials; the official Tunnel handles its runtime association.
- `serve-machine --stdio` makes the MCP child lifecycle unambiguous and avoids
  split-brain brokers.
- Explicit context capabilities prevent a Project, URL, path, or visible tab
  from becoming an accidental security principal.
- Persistent session pages preserve independent ChatGPT histories without
  taking over the user's ordinary conversations.
