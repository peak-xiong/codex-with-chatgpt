# Machine Gateway Implementation Plan

This is the implementation contract for the machine-wide architecture. It is
intentionally written as an end-state plan: no workspace-specific service or
second connection path is required.

Current experiment note: the mailbox design below is retained and tested, but
production result delivery is temporarily `computer_use`. See
`docs/protocol.md` for the active flow.

Transport note: the official OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel was removed and replaced
by a public HTTP endpoint reached through a third-party tunnel; the provider is
not fixed. Layer 2 below describes the current transport; the `--tunnel-id` /
`--runtime-key-file` / `--reuse-existing` options and `serve-machine --stdio`
no longer exist.

## Product requirements

1. Configure one ChatGPT connector per machine:
   `Codex with ChatGPT`, a public `Server URL`, and a bearer token.
2. Reach the gateway through one third-party tunnel forwarding the fixed
   loopback port `48765`.
3. Let the machine daemon own one `c2c serve-http` gateway process.
4. Route any registered workspace from trusted local `cwd` state.
5. Give every workspace one ChatGPT Project.
6. Give every local Codex session one persistent Project chat and one owned
   browser page.
7. Target the exact page `tabId`; never infer ownership from visibility.
8. Allow up to 100 concurrently active cross-session pages, counted by unique
   `(projectId, localSessionId)` identities, each representing one
   workspace-local session owner. When all 100 unexpired leases are held, a
   claim for a new 101st session is rejected with a retryable capacity result; it waits,
   backs off, and retries after capacity frees. Renewing, idempotently claiming,
   or replacing a page for an existing session does not consume another slot.
   Serialize only a single session's ordered control turns.
9. Scope backoff, retry and browser recovery to the affected session.
10. Require `context_id` on every MCP call and `CONTEXT_ID` in every control
    prompt.
11. On macOS, enable one LaunchAgent after setup and verify it with
    `c2c autostart status --json`.

## Delivery layers

### Layer 1: Machine identity and state

- Resolve a stable machine identity and create a unique `bootEpoch` per gateway
  lifetime.
- Store the recorded public endpoint, bearer token, admin token, lifetime record
  and workspace registrations in protected machine state.
- Store mutable workspace data inside the repository boundary: Git checkouts
  use `<git-common-dir>/codex-with-chatgpt`; non-Git workspaces use
  `<workspace-root>/.codex-with-chatgpt`.
- Keep the authoritative Project URL, physical-tab and generation ownership
  index in protected machine state. Workspace page files are recovery mirrors
  only and are never imported into that authority.
- Make state writes atomic and owner-checked.
- Never include bearer tokens or raw capabilities in status output.

Acceptance: a second process cannot publish over a healthy runtime; a stopped
process only clears its own exact record.

### Layer 2: Public HTTP transport

- Start the gateway as hidden `c2c serve-http`, binding loopback port `48765`
  (`DEFAULT_MACHINE_HTTP_PORT`, overridable by `C2C_HTTP_PORT`).
- Serve MCP at `POST /mcp`, guarded by a bearer token; an unauthenticated
  request returns `401`, and the process refuses to start without a token.
- Let the operator's third-party tunnel forward to that port. C2C neither
  installs nor supervises the tunnel client. Any tunnel that forwards a public
  HTTPS URL to the loopback port is valid; a Cloudflare named tunnel is
  preferred because its hostname survives reconnects, while a quick tunnel
  (Cloudflare `trycloudflare.com` or ngrok) changes hostname on every reconnect.
- Record the public base URL with `c2c machine endpoint set --url <https-url>`;
  the MCP URL is `<public-base-url>/mcp`.
- Persist the machine association id so the stored connector binding does not
  report `stale` after every restart.
- Stop the gateway process directly; it clears its own ownership record.

Acceptance: `machine status` exposes the transport view (`mcpUrl`, `localPort`,
`authConfigured`, `authTokenHint`) and `machine doctor` reports gateway, endpoint
and auth as separate checks — without exposing secrets.

### Layer 3: Machine autostart

- Install one machine-wide LaunchAgent only on macOS.
- Its `ProgramArguments` must be the hidden command
  `c2c autostart run --quiet`.
- The wake command only invokes `ensureMachineGateway`; it restarts the one
  `c2c serve-http` gateway if it is down and never starts a workspace-specific
  process or the tunnel.
- Enable and verify it once after machine setup:

  ```sh
  c2c autostart enable --json
  c2c autostart status --json
  ```

- Disable it with `c2c autostart disable --json`.

Acceptance: a login or wake event can recover the one managed machine runtime,
while no second gateway or browser-page scheduler is created.

### Layer 4: Workspace registry

- Register a trusted canonical root and derive `workspaceId` and `projectId`.
- Keep a current `registrationId` and revoke old registrations.
- Validate containment and root identity on every claim.
- Route explicit and automatically detected stale registration removal through
  the same capability-revocation and last-checkout cleanup lifecycle.
- Never use a Project or conversation id as filesystem authorization.

Acceptance: two workspaces can be registered at once; moving or replacing a
checkout requires a fresh registration; traversal and symlink escapes fail.

### Layer 5: Capability broker

- Issue random short-lived `CONTEXT_ID` values.
- Bind each capability to machine boot, workspace registration, Project,
  local session, task, iteration, phase, compaction epoch, page generation and
  scopes.
- Track claims with activity leases and renew them during long MCP calls.
- Revoke on expiry, cancellation, registration change, page rotation,
  compaction or gateway restart.
- Fence completion until leases drain, then write the mailbox result.

Acceptance: a token copied between sessions, tasks, phases, page generations or
machine boots is rejected; mailbox failure never becomes a false completion.

### Layer 6: Surface ownership

- Persist `projectId + localSessionId -> browserId + surfaceId + tabId` in the
  protected machine ownership index.
- Persist `projectId -> normalized projectUrl` independently of session leases
  so new sessions and linked worktrees reuse the existing ChatGPT Project.
- Require exact Project/chat URL matching.
- Enforce one local project per normalized ChatGPT Project URL and one owner
  per physical browser/surface/tab tuple across all registered workspaces.
- Give each surface a generation and owner process epoch.
- Keep a machine-wide generation allocator monotonic across release, expiry,
  and session retirement while pruning inactive per-session entries.
- Permit live replacement only with the exact current generation.
- Limit concurrently active session/page leases to 100 unexpired leases held by
  unique `(projectId, localSessionId)` identities, each representing one
  workspace-local session owner. Released, expired, and retired leases free
  capacity; a new-session claim in slot 101 is rejected with a retryable
  capacity result and retries after a slot is available. Renewals, idempotent
  claims, and page replacements for an existing session reuse its slot.

Acceptance: two local sessions in one Project own different tabs and can submit
independently; 100 distinct session/page owners can run concurrently; a new
101st claim is rejected and retries after capacity frees; renewal, idempotent
claim, or page replacement for an existing session does not add a slot; another
workspace cannot reuse that Project or either tab; a stale session or edited
workspace mirror cannot rotate or replay ownership.

### Layer 7: Mailbox correlation

- Open one request for one question/answer pair.
- Refuse to replace an existing open request with a new context.
- Validate exact request, session, task, iteration, phase and payload schema.
- Use `pending -> received -> acknowledged` with explicit cancellation and
  expiry states.
- Accept results only through the protected machine mailbox. Browser text is
  never a result transport.

Acceptance: a late result for a different request is rejected, and a wait
timeout never causes an implicit resend.

### Layer 8: ChatGPT workflow

- Have `machine setup` install or update one global Skill automatically rather
  than copying a project-specific setup.
- For a new workspace, create one Project and set project-only memory if the
  user chooses that ChatGPT mode.
- Start every new local session from the workspace Project collection page.
- Claim the new chat's exact `tabId` and save its URL only after
  `workspace_info` verifies the workspace.
- Use only the built-in browser, stable URLs and DOM APIs. Do not use
  screenshot-coordinate control for normal operations.
- Put `RESULT_REQUEST_ID`, `CONTEXT_ID`, `LOCAL_SESSION_ID`, `TASK_ID`,
  `ITERATION` and `RESULT_PHASE` in every control prompt.
- Send the next control message only after the current request is terminal.

Acceptance: a user's ordinary ChatGPT tabs remain untouched; each local session
has a visibly independent Project chat; ChatGPT passes `context_id` to every
MCP call.

## CLI surface

Machine lifecycle:

```text
c2c machine setup [--json]
c2c machine endpoint get|set --url <https-url>|clear [--json]
c2c machine auth show [--reveal]|rotate [--json]
c2c skill status [--json]
c2c machine start
c2c machine status [--json]
c2c machine doctor [--no-fix] [--json]
c2c machine stop
c2c sandbox-clean [--json]
c2c update-check -w <workspace-root> [--json]
c2c autostart enable [--json]
c2c autostart status [--json]
c2c autostart disable [--json]
```

`serve-http` is a hidden internal command; the machine daemon starts it and
callers should use `machine start`/`machine doctor` instead.

Workspace and context:

```text
c2c machine workspace register   # run from the workspace root
c2c machine workspace unregister --workspace-id ... --project-id ... --registration-id ...
c2c machine context issue ...
c2c machine context cancel --context-id ...
```

Session and page:

```text
c2c workspace                 # run from the workspace root
c2c surface get|claim|commit|renew|release|retire ...
c2c session get|set|clear ...  # set updates task/checkpoint metadata only
```

Control mailbox:

```text
c2c control open ...
c2c control status ...
c2c control wait ...
c2c control ack ...
c2c control cancel ...
```

`control cancel` is keyed by the exact request correlation and does not require
the capability token. Healthy gateways revoke matching live contexts by
request; a zero-match result is valid after a pre-issue crash or gateway
restart. A stopped gateway is restarted before the protected mailbox is
changed, while an uncertain gateway state fails closed.

## Non-goals

- More than 100 concurrently active session/page leases.
- A single global “active workspace” selected by whichever page is visible.
- User-provided absolute paths as ChatGPT authorization.
- A second MCP broker per workspace.
- Pasting repository content, diffs or logs into prompts.
- Browser screenshot coordinates as the routine automation API.
- Treating Project ids, chat ids, or model output as security credentials.
- Recreating the connection for every turn.

## Verification matrix

| Area | Required check |
| --- | --- |
| Build | `corepack pnpm typecheck` and `corepack pnpm build` |
| Tests | Full Vitest suite, including machine gateway, HTTP transport, mailbox and surface tests |
| Transport | `serve-http` binds the recorded loopback port, refuses to start without a token, and answers `401` to an unauthenticated `POST /mcp` |
| Endpoint | `machine endpoint set/get/clear` round-trips the public base URL and derives `<base>/mcp` |
| Isolation | Two or more workspaces and sessions route to their own roots/pages |
| Capacity | 100 unique `(projectId, localSessionId)` identities execute concurrently; a new 101st claim is rejected and retries until a lease releases, expires, or retires |
| Stale state | Old boot, registration, generation, epoch and context are rejected |
| Dormant mailbox | Duplicate open, late result, cancellation and write failure remain covered by tests |
| Browser | Exact `tabId` targeting; ordinary user tabs are untouched |
| Secrets | Bearer token, admin token and raw context absent from normal output |
| Docs | README, protocol, security and Skill agree on one connector, a public URL and a bearer token |

## Rollout order

1. Build and test the machine gateway, registry and broker locally.
2. Start the gateway, record the public endpoint and issue the bearer token.
3. On macOS, enable autostart once and verify its status.
4. Register one workspace and claim one Project chat.
5. Run a read-only BOOT check and a Computer Use result turn.
6. Add a second workspace and multiple sessions; verify independent tabs and
   affected-session-only recovery.
7. Install the global Skill and verify a fresh Codex session.
8. Run the full suite, doctor, secret scan, diff check and documentation review.

The rollout is complete only when the one-machine setup works for multiple
workspaces and sessions with the machine-wide 100-lease capacity, independent
session execution, and retry-after-capacity behavior.
